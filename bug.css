This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework that uses a different CSS reset or normalization library.  The conflicting styles can lead to unexpected rendering of components. For instance, box-sizing may be set differently causing padding or margin issues. This is especially true when mixing Tailwind with frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation without careful consideration of their styling overrides.
