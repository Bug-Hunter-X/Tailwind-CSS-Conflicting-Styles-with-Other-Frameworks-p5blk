The solution involves carefully managing the CSS specificity to ensure Tailwind styles override or complement the styles from the other framework. You can use techniques like: 

1. **Specificity Override:** Use more specific selectors in your Tailwind classes to ensure they take precedence. 
2. **!important:** Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary, as it can make your styles difficult to maintain. 
3. **CSS Preprocessor Variables:** If possible, utilize CSS preprocessor variables to manage common styles across the project. This makes it easier to resolve conflicting styles or change the theme with ease. 
4. **CSS Reset/Normalize:** Carefully select and apply a single CSS reset or normalization library (if any) for the entire project, ensuring consistency. 

Example (bugSolution.css):

/* ... other styles ... */

/* Resolve box-sizing conflict */
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: border-box !important; /*Use !important only if needed and understand the consequences*/
}

/* ... Tailwind classes ... */

/* ... other styles ... */
